#BZWorkbench

BZWorkbench is a full featured world editor for the game BZFlag.

It was initially written for the Google summer of code program in 2007.
After a few years of activity development stalled.
It is currently under active development again.

The current version's functionality is limited, as the first
goal was to make it compile again against the current versions
of the libraries it depends on. Specifically Open Scene Graph.

In its current state it:

- Compiles under (Arch) Linux,
- Can load and view maps,
- Can Add, Edit and Remove objects.
